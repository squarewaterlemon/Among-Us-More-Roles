# Among-Us-More-Roles
A Reactor plugin that adds more roles to Among Us.

This is a mod that adds more roles to Among Us using Reactor.

## Roles:
C - Creawmate Role

I - Impostor Role

N - Neutral Role

Jester (N) (v1.0) - Like other mods, the Jester is their own team. Their goal is to get themselves voted out. However, generally Jesters would rather have the Crewmates win than the Impostors.

Witness (C) (v1.0) - The Witness has custom vision and is immune to the lights sabatoge. You can customize the Witness vision in the pre-game settings.

Mechanic (C) (v1.0) - The Mechanic is simply a crewmate that is able to vent.

Sheriff (C) (v1.0) - The Sheriff has a kill button and their goal is to kill the Impostors. However, if they kill a Crewmate, they will die as well. Sheriff kill cooldown can be customized in the pre-game settings.

Snitch (C) (v1.0) - The Snitch must complete all their tasks, which will create arrows that point towards the Impostors (they cannot tell who the Impostors are in meetings, nor will it color their names red). However, when the Snitch has one task left, Impostors will be notified of who the Snitch is, and also get an arrow that points to the Snitch.

Recommended Steps to Install:

This mod is for Among Us version 2020.12.9s. It may not work properly on other versions

If you've never used Reactor or Dropship before, use this link and follow these instructions:

https://docs.reactor.gg/docs/basic/install_bepinex
1. Follow the instructions for "Install BepInEx" and "Install Reactor" under "Quick Start"
2. Next, go under "Install .NET SDK and Example template" and scroll down to "Setup Among Us environment variable". Follow the instructions under that section.
3. If you don't have Reactor Essentials installed yet, you will need to install that for this mod. Go to the Reactor Essentials Github repo (https://github.com/DorCoMaNdO/Reactor-Essentials), and download release 0.1.3 (for 2020.12.9s). You will place this in the plugins folder. This is found within the Among Us directory, which is likely at C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Among Us (on Windows). From there, open the BepInEx folder, then plugins, and place "Essentials-2020.12.9s.dll" into this folder.
4. Finally, download the More Roles Mod latest release. Place this in the same folder as Reactor Essentials. 
5. In order to play the mod, you will have to use a private server. I recommend the Impostor server (https://github.com/NuclearPowered/Impostor/suites/2150025130/artifacts/44013545). You'll want to unzip the Impostor-Patcher-Cli and Impostor-Server for your operating system. You must host the server on your own computer. All players that you want to share the mod with must use the Impostor client to connect to your server.
